# The-Quick-Project
Over **15 million** players have contributed millions of drawings playing **Quick, Draw!** These doodles are a unique data set that can help developers train new neural networks, help researchers see patterns in how people around the world draw, and help artists create things we havenâ€™t begun to think of. That's why these doodles are [freely available](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) for everyone to play with:

There are several ways to retrieve the dataset, via a Google Cloud Platform API call or by manually downloading them from the [CGP server](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap;tab=objects?pli=1&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false).

In this repository you will find projects that use these drawings.
